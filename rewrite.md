# **Rewrite Criteria**

Here are KPIs that can serve as acceptance criteria for a software rewrite in ZII:

**System performance**
Measure the improved performance of the new software compared to the legacy system. This can include metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.

**Scalability**
Assess the ability of the new software to handle increased workloads and user demands. Measure its scalability by monitoring the system's performance under different load conditions and determining how well it scales horizontally or vertically.

**Reliability**
Evaluate the new software's reliability by measuring the frequency and impact of system failures or errors. Consider metrics like uptime, mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and system availability.

**Security**
Evaluate the security of the new software by measuring its resistance to vulnerabilities and potential threats. Consider metrics such as the number of security incidents, the time to patch vulnerabilities, and adherence to security best practices.

**Maintainability**
Measure the ease of maintaining and updating the new software. Consider metrics like the time required to implement changes or add new features, the number of bugs or issues reported, and the clarity of the codebase.

**Data integrity**
Ensure the accuracy and integrity of data during the transition from the legacy system to the new software. Measure the success of data migration by tracking data validation errors, data loss, or data corruption.

**Cost-effectiveness**
Assess the cost-effectiveness of the software rewrite by measuring the impact on overall costs. Consider metrics like the reduction in maintenance costs, hardware requirements, or licensing fees.

**Document and train**
As the new software takes shape, document the system architecture, design choices, and any other relevant information. Provide comprehensive documentation and conduct training sessions for users, administrators, and developers to ensure a smooth transition to the new software.

**Deploy and monitor**
Once development and testing are complete, deploy the new software in a controlled environment. Monitor its performance, gather feedback, and address any issues that arise. Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track and address any potential problems.
